The Cuckoo Resource Adapter for SAP supports CCI as the client API.

Application developers may use the Hibersap framework for ease of use. Hibersap provides a state-of-the-art
API making use of Java annotations.

Cuckoo RA supports access to SAP from managed environments (Java EE application servers).
It does not yet support access to SAP from non-managed application clients; for example, Java applications.

The ResourceAdapter JavaBean represents a resource adapter instance and contains the configuration information
pertaining to that resource adapter instance. This configuration information is used as global defaults
for ManagedConnectionFactory and ActivationSpec JavaBeans. That is, when ManagedConnectionFactory or ActivationSpec
JavaBeans are created they inherit the global defaults (ResourceAdapter JavaBean configuration information),
which make it easier to configure them.

The Cuckoo RA uses properties common to the Resource Adapter and the ManagedConnectionFactory.
These "globally" defined properties can be overridden in the ManagedConnectionFactory configuration to be able
 to access different SAP systems.
